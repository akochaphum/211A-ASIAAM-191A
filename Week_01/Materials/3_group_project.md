# Due Friday 7/2:
1. Have one person create a new repo for the group and invite everyone as collaborators. 
- [Guide on how to create a new repo and invite](../Guides/git_creating.md) 
2. Add a `readme.md` to the repository that describes the following:
   - What social problem is being addressed
   - The local community or non-profit that is being empowered by your application
   - What problems you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical).
   
   > Note: This is your group's introduction to the world, make sure you use [Markdown formatting](https://Guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to style your content properly.  

**Extra Credit**: Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and incorporate them into the write-up.
